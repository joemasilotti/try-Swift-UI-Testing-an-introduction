# UI Testing: an introduction
Source code for my "UI Testing: an introduction" workshop at the [2020 try Swift! World conference](https://www.tryswift.co/world/#).

The `master` branch has application code to write tests against.

The `complete` branch and PR #1 include the UI Tests I'm planning to cover during the workshop.
